Pic Holly Molly sampling description

- Data set comprised of observations of individuals synthesized into
  hundreds of network models
- Data collected by two researchers in two locations 20 years ago
- Models developed by two researchers and tailored to current data

# Multilayer networks

Pic Preliminary results of temporal analysis

# Multilayer networks

# Reproducibility

Pic Reproduciblility [@baker2016]

# Open Process

# Data Provenance and Ecological Networks

- Network metrics and provenance [@Lau2017]
- Diffuse data collection
- Model benefaction

# ProvTools

- provR + RDataTracker
- cleanR

# Example application

enaR = Ecosystem Network Analysis in R [@borret2014]

- Show script building models
- Show provenance graph
- Show cleaning

# Policy Relevance

*OPEN*  = data + source + process

- Science is understanding and sharing is essential
- provenance capture
- code cleaning
- encapsulation
- Dataverse
- CI
