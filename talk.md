# Motivation

- Reproduciblility [@baker2016]
- Transparency [@pasquier2017]

# Motivation

- 
- Software legibility
- Data/model attribution

# Motivation

- Network metrics and provenance [@Lau2017]
- Diffuse data collection
- Model benefaction

# Targets

*OPEN* data + source + process

- provenance capture
- code cleaning
- encapsulation
- Dataverse
- CI

# Example: Multilayer food-web modeling and analysis

- Data set comprised of observations of individuals synthesized into
  hundreds of network models
- Data collected by two researchers in two locations 20 years ago
- Models developed by two researchers and tailored to current data

# Issues of trust, privacy and attribution


# Data transparency == Resource transparency 

Implications for policy and management

Example = seafood + sourcing
